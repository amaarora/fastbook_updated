# fastbook_updated
This is the updated version of [fastbook](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook) that I use to explain concepts spending roughly ~60 minutes per chapter. All sessions are recorded and can be found in this YT playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD80i8An1OEHdlrBwa7mKFaHX9tH86b93). We meet weekly every Thursday 1pm AEST.
